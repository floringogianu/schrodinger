# schrodinger

An investigation into uncertainty estimates for deep neural networks in the
context of software verification. Specifically we are interested in seeing if
traditional unit-test based software development practices blend well with the
specifics of deep learning software and if uncertainty estimates for deep
neural networks could play an interesting role.


## Methods

Some initial details on how we are planning to achieve this can be found in the document outlining the relevant [bibliography](../blob/master/docs/bibliography.md).
